\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector which consists of lifetime data. Lifetime data
could be every characteristic influencing the reliability of a product,
e.g. operating time (days/months in service), mileage (km, miles), load
cycles.}

\item{status}{A vector of binary data (0 or 1) indicating whether unit \emph{i}
is a right censored observation (= 0) or a failure (= 1).}

\item{dist_params}{A (named) numeric vector of (log-)location-scale parameters
returned from \code{\link{rank_regression}}.}

\item{distribution}{Supposed distribution of the random variable. Has to be in
line with the specification made in \code{\link{rank_regression}}.}

\item{b_lives}{A numeric vector indicating the probabilities \emph{p} of the
\eqn{B_p}-lives (quantiles) to be considered.}

\item{bounds}{A character string specifying of which bounds have to be computed.
One of \code{"two_sided"}, \code{"lower"} or \code{"upper"}.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level of the interval.}

\item{direction}{A character string specifying the direction of the
confidence interval. One of \code{"y"} (failure probabilities) or \code{"x"}
(quantiles).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods. Currently not used.}
}
\value{
A tibble with class \code{wt_confint} containing the following
columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{x} : An ordered sequence of the lifetime characteristic regarding
      the failed units, starting at \code{min(x)} and ending up at \code{max(x)}.
      With \code{b_lives = c(0.01, 0.1, 0.5)} the 1\%, 10\% and 50\% quantiles
      are additionally included in \code{x}, but only if the specified
      probabilities are in the range of the estimated probabilities.
    \item \code{rank} : Interpolated ranks as a function of probabilities,
      computed with the converted approximation formula of Benard.
    \item \code{prob} : An ordered sequence of probabilities with specified
      \code{b_lives} included.
    \item \code{lower_bound} : Provided, if \code{bounds} is one of
      \code{"two_sided"} or \code{"lower"}. Lower limit of the confidence region
      with respect to \code{direction}, i.e. quantiles or probabilities.
    \item \code{upper_bound} : Provided, if \code{bounds} is one of
      \code{"two_sided"} or \code{"upper"}. Upper limit of the confidence region
      with respect to \code{direction}, i.e. quantiles or probabilities.
    \item \code{cdf_estimation_method} : A character that is always
      \code{NA_character}. Due to the generic visualization functions this
      column has to be provided.
  }

  Further information is stored in the attributes of this tibble:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{distribution} : Specified distribution (determined when calling
      \code{\link{rank_regression}}).
    \item \code{bounds} : Specified bound(s).
    \item \code{direction} : Specified direction.
  }
}
\description{
This non-parametric approach computes the beta binomial bounds (BB) for
quantiles and failure probabilities using a procedure similar to the calculation
of probabilities in terms of (\emph{Median Ranks}).
}
\details{
The difference to \emph{Median Ranks}, i.e. finding the probability of
rank \emph{j} at a 50\% level, is to determine the probability of rank \emph{j}
on another level, the specified confidence level.
